# Movie Review Hadoop Implementation

The task in completing this assignment is to analyse some movie review data. The data are contained in a file called ratedReviews.txt. The file contains the text of movie reviews, each followed by a score from 1 to 9 indicating a rating given to the movie. Each review and score pair are on a single line of the file and the scores are separated from the reviews by a tab character.

The task is to write the Map/Reduce code in Java needed to process the movie reviews in a way that discovers the most common word used in reviews with each possible rating. The result will be 9 words: one for each score, which represent the most common word used in reviews with each rating score. The stop words provided should not be counted.

Step 1, HDFS
Before the writing any code, you will need to copy the data onto your own space in HDFS. In the report, give details of how HDFS stores data such as this (assume the file is much bigger than it really is for the purpose of your description). Describe what HDFS is for, the architecture it uses, and the roles of different nodes in the cluster. Document the hdfs commands you used to create a directory for the data and place it there. 
 

Step 2, Design
Now consider the Map/Reduce design you will implement. You know there are only nine different scores associated with the movie reviews and a larger (but unknown) number of different words used in those reviews. Consider and compare two different choices you could make to implement the given task. What keys and values will the mapper emit? Consider how much data will be moved across the network in each of your two designs. Also consider how many different reducers will be used in each case. Finally, choose one of the two designs to implement and justify your choice.

Step 3, Implement
Using the MovieReview.java file provided on the assignment page in Canvas as a starting point, modify this code to produce the results requested above. This code is just a renamed version of the original WordCount.java file from your practicals and will need significant changes to meet the desired requirements (including changing some of the types of the Key/Value pairs) . It is supplied with the file TestMoveReview.java that you can use with the Hadoop simulator mochadoop to check your logic on the smaller set of data found in shortReviews.txt. Your final output should however be produced from the full ratedReviews.txt file that should be run on the Hadoop server.

There is a list of words that should not be counted in the reviews â€“ they are given in the file exclude.txt, which you can download from the Canvas assignment page. This list should be loaded into your program from the file, not hard coded into the MovieReview code.

You should now implement your design in Java using the Hadoop API that we have been using in class. Your code should find the most commonly used word (excluding those in the exclusion list) for movies with each rating from 1 to 9. You should allow the exclusion list to be supplied as a cache file (do not hard code the list into your Java). Make sure you implement a mapper, a combiner (if your design allows it) and a reducer.
